## Overview

This project aims to perform text classification on a Consumer Complaints dataset to categorize consumer complaints into predefined classes. The goal is to build and evaluate multiple machine learning models to automatically classify these complaints based on their content.

## Sub-Tasks

### Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering

In this section, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights into the data distribution. Additionally, we conduct feature engineering to extract relevant features from the text data that can be used for modeling.

### Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the text data to make it suitable for machine learning models. Common steps include lowercasing, tokenization, stop-word removal, and more.

### Selection of Multi-Classification Model

We select and implement various multi-classification models, including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, and Ensemble Voting Classifier. Each model is briefly explained in this section.

### Comparison of Model Performance

We compare the performance of the selected models using appropriate evaluation metrics. This section provides insights into how each model performs on the task.

### Model Evaluation

Model evaluation involves assessing the accuracy and performance of each model. We highlight that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) model performed exceptionally well, achieving an accuracy of 87%.

### Prediction

Once the best-performing model is identified, it is used for making predictions on new consumer complaints.

## Models Used

- **Decision Tree**: A decision tree is a tree-like model used for classification and regression. It splits the data into branches based on features.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm that assigns labels to data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors.

- **Naive Bayes**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that is based on Bayes' theorem. It is particularly suited for text classification tasks.

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: SGD is an optimization algorithm used for training linear classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Logistic Regression.

- **Random Forest**: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification performance.

- **Ensemble Voting Classifier**: An ensemble classifier that combines predictions from multiple base classifiers to make a final decision.

## Results

The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) model outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 87% during the model evaluation phase.
